# gelion bypass

gelion bypass is a tool designed to bypass the authentication system of "keyauth" whilst also dumping, this is purely for educational purposes. 

Contributers : Vathl (Vathl designed the general idea of the hook and proposed it to me.)

## How it Works

well its simple, we just hook keyauth requests with minhook and return whatever we want, dump files, switch auths, give fake files, swap files (basically anything)

## Usage

just build and inject into the file you want.

NOTE : i tried to keep the code as clean as possible.
